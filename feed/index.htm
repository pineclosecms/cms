										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 12th May 2024, at 9:51PM someone who we&#8217;ve seen hanging out with the tenant of number 14 in the past was attempting to open our front door and then kept coming back to try messing with things or break in, he can be seen with another person who is more than likely the tenant of number 14 for multiple reasons including: We&#8217;ve seen them together in the past, we could hear the stairs before and after, they kept going back to the front of 14 etc<br />
In the end i had to go shout to him to make him go away before Lucy had a heart attack due to her heart conditions or he smashed something up.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
Nobody Yet, waiting for someone to finally get back in touch with us&#8230; still&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Very stressful and not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart conditions and now she can&#8217;t sleep until the sun comes up every night from stress of everything.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Very stressed, not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart condition, Associated with the tenant of number 14.</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>At 9:51PM a person we&#8217;ve seen talking to the tenant of number 14 in the past was trying the door handle on our house, he can first be seen heading straight for the door and then attempting to open it with the side of his hand as to not leave a fingerprint probably, and then walking away when realizing it&#8217;s locked. he walks to the right, then seconds later back to the left (towards number 14)<br />
another minute later its clear he&#8217;s with someone else as you can see in the video. It&#8217;s obvious to us it&#8217;s the tenant of number 14 because he&#8217;s the only person with any reason to mess around with our stuff in the first place, and with him being a known drug dealer, it&#8217;s likely he gave the guy some for messing with our door in the first place.<br />
eventually i went to the door to shout at him, ask him what he was doing and to tell him to go away because lucy was getting very stressed and could have had a heart attack with her heart condidions, or before he put the window through or something, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">(which is likely what happened before seen as they were two of them when our window was broken on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #00ccff; text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #00ccff; text-decoration: underline;" href="/10jan2024/">January 10th.</a></span></span>)</span><br />
When shouting to him at the door, his responses were all slued, like he was half asleep giggling, defiantly on something, more than likely given from number 14 tenant).<br />
Then after we could hear them on the stairs, quieter than normally but time lines up.<br />
<strong><br />
Conversation:</strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Me shouting to the guy outside before Lucy had a stress heart attack (Video + Audio below)</span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> The F**k you doing?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> inaudible</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me <em>(to Lucy)</em></strong> what did he say?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Lucy <em>(to me)</em></strong> I Don&#8217;t know, i can&#8217;t tell..</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> what are you doing out there</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> I&#8217;m Waiting</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> For what?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong>*Inaudible mumbling*</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> Waiting for what</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy outside:</strong> More inaudible mumbling</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> What?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> I&#8217;m waiting for my mate</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> Well why are you waiting outside our door?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> *Inaudible mumbling&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> We&#8217;ve seen you try the handle</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy outside:</strong> I Didn&#8217;t try the door handle, what you talking about?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> We just saw you try the F****ng door handle</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> I didn&#8217;t try the door handle, I&#8217;m waiting for my mate</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> Well, stop pissing about outside the house and go wait somewhere else</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy outside:</strong> Alright (<em>walks towards number 14, then goes upstairs</em>)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 26th April 2024,we were woken up by loud banging, looking at the camera we noticed the tenant from number 14 forcefully removing our bird feeder from the wall. checking the recordings we found he was sticking his finger up at our room camera at 1:50am, then at 2:32am he can be see walking towards the front and pacing around outside. then at 5:30 he took his dog out and looked around to see if anyone was around, took the dog back in and came back out alone where he trashed out bird feeder. Finally at 5:50am we can be seen at the living room window sticking up his middle finger again and saying something that looks to be &#8220;f**k off you stupid bastards&#8221; then walks back towards his flat.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH and the police</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Caused a lot of stress that negatively affects Lucy&#8217;s heart condition&#8217;s<strong>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Stressed, Annoying, logged as &#8220;criminal damage&#8221;,</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong><br />
We were woken up around 5:30am by a lode of banging and stomping, whilst awake we could see a screen showing our door camera showing the tenant from number 14 ripping our bird feeder off the wall, (possibly cut due to steel core cable ties being used), he then crumpled it up off camera and threw it into our brown bin.<br />
we got up and checked the recordings from the entire night and morning and found that he was at our living room window at 1:50AM sticking his middle finger up at it.<br />
At 2:32AM he can be seen again walking back towards the front, then he went on to pacing up and down around our front door.<br />
Around 5:20 there was lodes of banging and stomping (heard through silicone ear plugs) that&#8217;s what originally woke us up, then he took his dog out onto the grass and was looking around (as if checking nobody was around), he can then be seen taking the dog back inside and coming back alone, and pace up and down outside our front door (looking at the door continually as if to see if anyone comes), he does this for around 10 minus in total, during which he spits on the front door and the proceeds to move our chairs and rip/cut our bird feeder off the wall as mentioned above.<br />
The bird feeder has been up around a year after we had to replace the first one we had because &#8220;someone&#8221; destroyed that as well..<br />
At 5:50AM we saw him sticking his middle finger up at it, then proceeds to say something that looks to be &#8220;f**k off you stupid bastards&#8221; then walks back towards his flat.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong><br />
We were woken up by a very loud bang <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(heard through silicone earplugs)</span>, followed by the sound of running up stairs shortly after.<br />
We checked our Door CCTV to find the tenant of number 14 had gone past and within a minute a loud bang can be heard, followed by him quickly walking back and running upstairs.<br />
We checked the windows and couldn&#8217;t see anything so went back to bed.<br />
The next morning however, when we were on our way to go shopping, we saw what caused the loud bang the night before, the drainpipe was all trashed on the ground, fittings ripped off and in pieces.<br />
We&#8217;ve taken pictures of how it was found and attached them, as well as a Door CCTV recording that shows him passing followed by going back upstairs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 9th Match 2024, we were woke up by the letterbox flapping and noticed the tenant from number 14 looking in the letter box with his phone on two occasions. Once at 4:14am and then again at 6:10am second time with the flash on and camera app can be seen open on his phone. We did get this on CCTV which was sent to the police.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH and the police</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Made us worried he will try doing something again, possible checking what camera we have and where they are as he seemed to be recording and/or taking pictures with his phone, and he&#8217;ll be aware that the cameras can be viewed behind the front door from the time he previously put a brick through it.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Tired, Very Stressed, Lucy has stress chest pain, and can&#8217;t sleep</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>We were woken up in the early hours to some noise that turned out to be the letterbox flapping, looking on the cameras we saw that it was one again the tenant from number 14 messing about, he was using his phone to look through our letterbox.<br />
The main reason he would likely want to do this is to see where out cameras are setup, because behind the door is a laptop screen showing 2 of them we have setup, and he would know that from the time he put a brick through the window and saw it.<br />
The first time he did it is when we were originally woken up by it at exactly 4:14AM, he can be seen lurking around and then looking through the letterbox with the phone, likely recording / taking pictures.<br />
The second time was at 6:10am which we saw live because we hadn&#8217;t been back to sleep after the first time expecting something else to happen (again).<br />
We reported it to the police who have since dragged it out for months, not getting in touch with us when they were meant to, we even contacted them for an update and heard nothing back again <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(2Â½ months from this writing)</span>. the incident report is still marked as &#8220;open&#8221; on there website. because of this lack of effort by the police, WDH have been unable to move forward with there work.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> (New camera setup, a21 phone camera in door peep hole + clear door view)<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Â ~this setup was new and didn&#8217;t have a microphone at the time.</em></span><br />

					<description><![CDATA[Summery: on the 10th January 2024, we were out for Lucy&#8217;s Birthday, when we came home our front door window&#46;&#46;&#46;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 10th January 2024, we were out for Lucy&#8217;s Birthday, when we came home our front door window had been smashed with a brick by the tenant of number 14, Police were called and sent CCTV that we had as you could hear the neighbour talking to someone outside. (the officer we spoke with that listened to the recording believe they are making up a fake story, portending someone else did it)</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH and the police</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Caused Extreme stress, ruined Lucy&#8217;s birthday and gave her bad chest pain, almost killing her again with stress because of her heart conditions, and we had to pay Â£67 to have this fixed and boarded up due to the hole in the glass, our cat got glass in her eye which caused her both pain and stress.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Extreme Stress, Lucy has stress chest pain, glass everywhere, cat&#8217;s eye injured, we had to pay instead of the person who smashed it.</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>We went out for Lucy&#8217;s Birthday for dinner, and came back to hour flat&#8217;s front door window smashed with a brick, It was instantly obvious who would have done it because we have literally no enemy&#8217;s at all, we get along with everyone, including our other neighbour, but the tenant from, 14 has been nothing but a cancer on the whole street for everyone, from what the other neighbour have told us, he&#8217;s caused lodes of problems for them too, from being a drunk nuisance to assaulting another neighbour with a metal baseball bat for no reason, then making up a lie and getting away with it.<br />
We went inside and checked the Letter Box cam we had setup at the time and found that it was done by 2 people, The tenant of number 14 (which was obvious) and one of his henchmen (people that hang out with him for drugs).<br />
They made up a fake conversation claiming that someone in a balaclava had done it and run away, but even the police officer who listened to it didn&#8217;t believe that and advised us he&#8217;s more than likely making it up to cover his actions.<br />
Because the camera we used at the time couldn&#8217;t see anything more than the ground nothing was done, not even any questioning, he just got away with it again.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> (old LetterBox cam pointing at ground but has audio)<br />

		<title>Eggs thrown at house &#124; 18th December 2023</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 18th December 2023, we were woken up to the sound of shouting and eggs being thrown at our house aswell as banging on the door.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
We reported the incident to WDH who opened a new case up with Joe.<br />
We previously had Richard who didn&#8217;t do much to help us, he wanted to close our case often and failed to put us on the out of hours list at the time he said he would, because of that we missed 3 opportunity to use it, since we did get added though, the noise is too spread out to predict when to have it observed. He had also told us he would change the case from a noise complaint to an harassment and assault case after i was attacked on the 25th September 2023 but didn&#8217;t do that, and then closed our case a week later.<br />
Joe however has been a lot more helpful so far.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Caused more worrying as every time I hear a noise anymore, I panic fearing it is the neighbour doing something else, this has gotten worse after this happened. It is also another reason we do not go out much anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
Our door was trashed again by him (again), We were woken up probably for the 10000th time since moving in, animals were scared, Not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart conditions (that we made him aware of back when we moved in), Everything covered in egg (again) and when cleaned off he re-eggs it every time</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>We were woken up around every half an hour by what sounded like hammering on the floor from around 10pm.<br />
We were then woken by shouting and banging on our front door, We checked our cameras to find that our front door, spare bedroom, bathroom and kitchen had all been egged.<br />
We checked our letter box camera (old camera setup) and could see his feet and hear his voice while pounding on our door yelling â€˜shut the fuck upâ€™(we had been in bed since 9pm).<br />
is then seen walking back and then the door been pelted with eggs.<br />
The door handle had also broken (again), we assume he had tried to get in again as he has done this a few times before. The handle was stuck up and no longer retracted correctly.<br />
shortly before this we caw him knock briefly, walk away and wait, then throw eggs at small bedroom window, it can be heard on the Door Cam but can&#8217;t been seen on our old setup. Due to the time gap it&#8217;s easy to assume he planned on throwing those eggs in the house and/or at us when the door was opened</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Summery: On the 25th September 2023, I was attacked whilst doing nothing more than attempting to have a cig outside&#46;&#46;&#46;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:</strong><br />
On the 25th September 2023, I was attacked whilst doing nothing more than attempting to have a cig outside the flat.<br />
Unfortunately at this time we didn&#8217;t have a camera set up that could see outside because something like this was unexpected as we get on with every single other neighbour in the area and have had zero enemy&#8217;s up-to this point, the attached footage is us coming in afterwards and him attempting to brake in before the police turned up.</p>
<p><strong>Assault Summery:<br />
</strong>Tenant of 14 Pine Close attacked me (tenant of 15 pine close) for no reason, instantly fought dirty and made no attempt to stop even when it was clear i was only trying to get away and not fight back because i believed back then there was still chance for peace.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for assault:</strong><br />
We think he had run out of cocaine, and was acting childish because we had recently reported him for making too much noise (which we attempted to speak with him about like polite adults, as have WDH and the environmental health agency to no avail because he simply ignores everyone.)</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
We reported the incident to WDH and the police.<br />
the police arrested him but he was simply able to lie, saying that I started it, and got out the next day, then as soon as he came back, he smashed our house wall up at side of the door.<br />
WDH Logged it but at the time we were dealing with a guy named Richard who was not interested in helping us at all and just wanted to close our issue all the time, as well as that he failed to put us on the out of hours list when he said he would, of which we attempted to use 3 times that week and missed our best opportunity for it, since then he&#8217;s been able to realize we can report noise and separates him loud bangs randomly on purpose making it impossible to predict for someone from WDH to come witness.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Michael had to be taken to a&amp;e due to the swelling on his face and eye (he could not see properly for over 2 months out of the eye the neighbour put his thumb in). He had a serious concussion, facial bruising and eye injury. Caused a lot of stress and worry. Caused us to not leave the house a lot as well as no longer going to the door and smoking and instead smoking in the house due to worry this would happen again. Caused us to no longer go out in the dark as well as no longer having Michaelâ€™s brother &amp; sister come down due to fear they might end up been involved or targeted by him. This was also same for my nana who lives a few doors up. We do worry anytime we see him, thinking he is going to try and do this again or worse. We also started sleeping in the living room rather than our bed room as it is the first room you get too when you enter the house, and as he has now tried to get inside more than once we are worried about him breaking in and feel safer sleeping well away.<br />
Also worried about the structure of the door and if he could break in from doing this. Stressed that it had happened and nothing seemed to be getting done. Letters were sent but no response to them nor was there any contact from him to them or vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
My eye was blurry for about 2 months can still hurt to this day when touched, He threaten to murder us both, He physically assaulted one of us and would have assaulted us both if we hadn&#8217;t got back in when we did, A&amp;E said I had a serious concussion, He Lied to the police claiming that I started it, and got let out fast, then smashed our wall up (likely attempting one of many braking attempts).</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>Assaulted outside flat for no reason whilst having a cig, and moving the trash off our door step he put childishly threw there and spat all over. Tenant from 14 Pine Close came out shouting &#8220;What the F**k are you doing&#8221;, ran up to me (Tenant from 15 Pine Close) and started punching me, I pulled his jacket over his face in an attempt to throw him off so we could get back in the house but he threw me on the ground via his finger in my right eye socket, held my head down jamming his finger past my eyeball and punching me in he head with the other hand, because of the finger in the eye i felt like i was falling to sleep, if my partner who I&#8217;m supposed to care for due to her many disability&#8217;s hadn&#8217;t have pulled him off of me, he would 100% have blinded me and likely attempted to murder me.<br />
We were able to get into the house fast and call the police, during that he was throwing his self at the door aswell as random items outside causing permanent damage to the door that WDH had to repair (again)<br />
When the police eventually got here they immediately arrested him and took pictures of my face, then sent me to A&amp;E, there i was rapidly checked over and sent back home with no medication and had to endure a swollen face and blurry vision and 16 paracetamol a day for about 2 months whilst he got nothing but a overnight stay in a cell, then as soon as he came home the next day, he immediately smashed up our wall next to the door, which WDH had to re-concrete.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 14th August 2023, we were tidying up in the Living Room and out of nowhere, for no reason at all, the neighbour from upstairs came stomping down and threw an entire box of eggs all over our living room windows and ran off up the street.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>We became very stressed, rang Richard from WDH anti-social department who came to look at what had been done. Lucy was too stressed &amp; worried and had to go over to her mum&#8217;s to calm down from the stress as it was causing bad chest pains, feeling dizzy and berating funny, yet another example of an instance he could have killed her with his childish behavior, and this is one of the lesser things he&#8217;s done.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Very Stressed, windows all egged <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>(happened again and again after cleaning)</em></span>, Lucy almost passed out from stress and had to leave <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(could have been worse.)</span></p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>Upstairs had already been stomping about shouting all day and we couldn&#8217;t concentrate on anything much.<br />
We were both in the living room tidying up and suddenly for no reason at all, the tenant of number 14 came stomping down stairs with a full box of eggs and threw them all at our room window, then ran off down the street laughing like a child.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>Between the 18th June 2023 and the 24th July 2023 we produced a set of log&#8217;s detailing everything we could hear in detail for Richard of WDH.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong><br />
For just short of a month we created details logs of everything we heard in that time, the information logged is arranged in an easy to understand way and scored between 1 and 10 on how bad the noise was, and what times.<br />
We originally created these for Richard at WDH as he said written logs could help however he didn&#8217;t seem to be interested in them nor did he bring anything up regarding them.</p>
<p><strong>Document :</strong> (Detailed logs given to Richard at WDH for the 28th June 2023 &#8211; 24th July 2023)<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 29th June 2023, we were woken by constant banging, stomping and shouting for hours on end, we couldn&#8217;t concentrate on anything or get any sleep at all,</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Extreme stress caused, both in tears and not knowing what to do. We contacted one call who reported it again as a noise complaint. We had been woken up again and then due to the noise couldnâ€™t get back to sleep or get any sleep during the day due to it.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Very Stressed, Lucy has stress chest pain, can&#8217;t sleep, can&#8217;t concentrate</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>We were woken up around 3AM to extremely loud banging and shouting, every time we tried to get back to sleep we were woken back up by it, so we got up and sat in the room for some time where we were unable to concentrate on anything, we ended up so stressed we were both in tears and Lucy&#8217;s chest became painful. As we&#8217;ve mentioned before it&#8217;s not good for her heart conditions and at this rate will eventually kill her, we&#8217;ve even posted letters to them in the past telling them that she has heart conditions and got completely ignored, told WDH multiple times to no avail.<br />
The noise continued until 7AM, by that point we were too stressed to get to sleep for hours anyway.</p>
