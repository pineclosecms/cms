The situation escalated when the individual spat on our door, disposed of a half smoked cig in our pet water bowl turning it yellow, and removed our chairs, leaving them down the road. This incident has been reported to the police via 101, PC Daniel O&#8217;Neil via email, and Sam Palmer, our council representative, through One Call, who has been updated on the ongoing issues.<\/p>\n<p>At approximately 7:15 AM, the neighbor emerged from his residence, smoking a cigarette while pacing in front of our door area. After two minutes of this behavior, he positioned himself near our outdoor chairs, which we use as a bird table due to a previous incident where he attempted to break in by smashing them against our door. He partially finished his cigarette and discarded it into the pet water bowl turning it yellow before returning to his flat.<\/p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later, the individual reappeared, briefly surveying the area before retreating to retrieve his dog. He then stood on the grass with the dog while continuing to look around, only to return the dog to his flat after a short period. Two minutes later, he reemerged, fixating on our door and chairs, he spat at our front door again, and walked past. He was then observed moving slowly across the area, seemingly checking for witnesses. He approached our chairs, stared at them, looked around once more, and proceeded to take them, walking towards the road. Finally, he hurriedly returned to his flat, walking past a man from over the road with his dog, Sid, in the process.
