His behavior suggested he was checking for witnesses.<br \/>\n7:05 PM: he left his residence, heading towards the park up the hill.<br \/>\n7:30 PM: Upon returning, he crossed the grass towards our bins, paused, then approached the chairs, spat on them, and proceeded to his flat.<br \/>\n10:21 PM: he was then seen pacing outside.<br \/>\n10:22 PM: He walked past the window, looking at the camera while smoking.<br \/>\n10:24 PM: he then passed by again, moving towards the front of the property.<br \/>\n10:25 PM: he approached our front door and stood staring for several seconds. He attempted to discard his cigarette in our outdoor pet water bowl, initially missing. He then bent down, retrieved the cigarette end, and deliberately placed it in the water.<br \/>\nHe retreated backwards, maintaining his gaze on the door, seemingly waiting for a reaction. After pausing at a distance, he moved towards our bins before returning to his flat.<br \/>\nAll incidents from 6:30 PM onwards have been reported to the police via their online chat system, as advised due to high call volumes. The report has been forwarded to PC O&#8217;Neil.<br \/>\nThis matter will be further reported to WDH on Monday, following the scheduled police appointment on Sunday at 10 PM.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Video:<br \/>\n<\/strong> <video controls=\"controls\" width=\"600\" height=\"340\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><source src=\"\/videos\/21st-Sep-2024-c2-cnn.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\" \/><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><\/video><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summery: &#8212;1.
