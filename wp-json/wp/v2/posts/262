This person repeatedly returned to our property, engaging in suspicious behavior that suggested an intent to vandalize or forcibly enter. Accompanying this individual was another person, whom we have strong reasons to believe is the tenant of number 14. This belief is substantiated by prior observations of their association, auditory evidence of movement on the staircase correlating with their presence, and their recurrent proximity to the front area of number 14.<br \/>\nThe situation necessitated my intervention to vocally confront the individual in question to prevent further escalation, considering the severe health risk posed to an individual with pre-existing heart conditions, and the potential for property damage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reported To:<\/strong><br \/>\nWe told the police by phone whilst inquire about a callback that was due over two months ago. However, it seems improbable that the report was logged, as we have yet to receive any follow-up communication from them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impact:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Very stressful and not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart conditions and now she can&#8217;t sleep until the sun comes up every night from stress of everything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Points:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Very stressed, not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart condition, Associated with the tenant of number 14.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Details:<br \/>\n<\/strong>At precisely 9:51 PM, an individual previously observed in communication with the occupant of flat number 14 was witnessed manipulating the door handle of our flat. Initially, the individual approached the door directly and appeared to attempt entry using the side of their hand, presumably to avoid leaving fingerprints. Upon realizing the door was secured, the individual departed, initially veering right, then returning left in the direction of residence number 14.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, it became evident that the individual was not alone, as another person appeared alongside them in the video footage. It is our assertion that the primary subject is the tenant of number 14, who has both the motive and the history to justify suspicion of tampering with our property. This individual\u2019s known involvement in drug-related activities lends credence to the likelihood of a quid pro quo arrangement, wherein the accomplice was compensated with narcotics for meddling with our door.<\/p>\n<p>In light of the distressing situation, particularly due to the potential health risks posed to Lucy, an individual with pre-existing heart conditions, I felt compelled to address the individual at the door. My intent was to inquire about their actions and to insist on their departure to alleviate the stress on the aforementioned individual. The responses received were slurred and punctuated with giggles, indicative of intoxication, presumably resulting from substances obtained from the tenant of number 14.<\/p>\n<p>Following this confrontation, we heard sounds consistent with someone ascending the staircase. Although the noise was quieter than usual, the timing aligned with the observed activities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conversation:<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"> Me shouting to the guy outside before Lucy had a stress heart attack (Video + Audio below)<\/span><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> The F**k you doing?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy Outside:<\/strong> inaudible<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me <em>(to Lucy)<\/em><\/strong> what did he say?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Lucy <em>(to me)<\/em><\/strong> I Don&#8217;t know, i can&#8217;t tell..<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> what are you doing out there<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy Outside:<\/strong> I&#8217;m Waiting<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> For what?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy Outside:<\/strong>*Inaudible mumbling*<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> Waiting for what<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy outside:<\/strong> More inaudible mumbling<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> What?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy Outside:<\/strong> I&#8217;m waiting for my mate<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> Well why are you waiting outside our door?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy Outside:<\/strong> *Inaudible mumbling&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> We&#8217;ve seen you try the handle<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy outside:<\/strong> I Didn&#8217;t try the door handle, what you talking about?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> We just saw you try the F****ng door handle<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy Outside:<\/strong> I didn&#8217;t try the door handle, I&#8217;m waiting for my mate<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Me:<\/strong> Well, stop pissing about outside the house and go wait somewhere else<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>Guy outside:<\/strong> Alright (<em>walks towards number 14, then goes upstairs<\/em>)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Video:<\/strong> (New camera setup, a21 phone camera in door peep hole + clear door view)<br \/>\n<video controls=\"controls\" width=\"600\" height=\"340\"><span style=\"display: inline-block;
