It&#8217;s obvious to us it&#8217;s the tenant of number 14 because he&#8217;s the only person with any reason to mess around with our stuff in the first place, and with him being a known drug dealer, it&#8217;s likely he gave the guy some for messing with our door in the first place.<br \/>\neventually i went to the door to shout at him, ask him what he was doing and to tell him to go away because lucy was getting very stressed and could have had a heart attack with her heart condidions, or before he put the window through or something, <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">(which is likely what happened before seen as they were two of them when our window was broken on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #00ccff;
