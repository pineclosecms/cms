He had also told us he would change the case from a noise complaint to an harassment and assault case after i was attacked on the 25th September 2023 but didn&#8217;t do that, and then closed our case a week later.<br \/>\nJoe however has been a lot more helpful so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impact:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Caused more worrying as every time I hear a noise anymore, I panic fearing it is the neighbour doing something else, this has gotten worse after this happened. It is also another reason we do not go out much anymore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Points:<\/strong><br \/>\nOur door was trashed again by him (again), We were woken up probably for the 10000th time since moving in, animals were scared, Not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart conditions (that we made him aware of back when we moved in), Everything covered in egg (again) and when cleaned off he re-eggs it every time<\/p>\n<p><strong>Details:<br \/>\n<\/strong>We were woken up around every half an hour by what sounded like hammering on the floor from around 10pm.<br \/>\nWe were then woken by shouting and banging on our front door, We checked our cameras to find that our front door, spare bedroom, bathroom and kitchen had all been egged.<br \/>\nWe checked our letter box camera (old camera setup) and could see his feet and hear his voice while pounding on our door yelling \u2018shut the fuck up\u2019(we had been in bed since 9pm).<br \/>\nis then seen walking back and then the door been pelted with eggs.<br \/>\nThe door handle had also broken (again), we assume he had tried to get in again as he has done this a few times before. The handle was stuck up and no longer retracted correctly.<br \/>\nshortly before this we caw him knock briefly, walk away and wait, then throw eggs at small bedroom window, it can be heard on the Door Cam but can&#8217;t been seen on our old setup. Due to the time gap it&#8217;s easy to assume he planned on throwing those eggs in the house and\/or at us when the door was opened<\/p>\n<p><strong>Video:<\/strong> (Can&#8217;t find the video without text overlay, this one has text descriptions)<br \/>\n<video controls=\"controls\" width=\"600\" height=\"480\"><source src=\"\/videos\/18th%20December%202023.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\" \/><\/video><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summery: on the 18th December 2023, we were woken up to the sound of shouting and eggs being thrown at&#46;&#46;&#46;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":65,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[4,13,7,6],"tags":[10],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=50"}],"version-history":[{"count":24,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":53,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/50\/revisions\/53"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/65"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=50"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=50"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=50"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
