Upon consulting our security camera, we observed the resident of unit number 14 engaging in the forceful dismantlement of our bird feeder affixed to the wall. A review of the recorded footage revealed that at 1:50 AM, this individual directed an offensive gesture towards our room camera. At 2:32 AM, he was documented returning to the front of the property, where he loitered and exhibited restless behavior.<br \/>\nAt 5:30 AM, the individual emerged with his dog, seemingly conducting a visual inspection of the surroundings. After escorting the dog back inside, he returned alone and proceeded to vandalize our bird feeder. Subsequently, at 5:50 AM, he was captured by the living room window repeating the offensive gesture and uttering a phrase that could be interpreted as a derogatory remark, before retreating to his residence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reported To:<\/strong><br \/>\nWDH and the police<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impact:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Caused a lot of stress that negatively affects Lucy&#8217;s heart condition&#8217;s<strong>.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Points:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Stressed, Annoying, logged as &#8220;criminal damage&#8221;,<\/p>\n<p><strong>Details:<br \/>\n<\/strong>At approximately 5:30 AM, we were abruptly awakened by a series of loud bangs and heavy footsteps. Upon awakening, we observed through our door camera\u2019s live feed that the individual residing at flat number 14 was forcibly removing our bird feeder from the exterior wall. It appeared that the feeder was detached, possibly by severing the steel core cable ties securing it. Subsequently, the individual was seen off-camera compressing the feeder and discarding it into our brown waste container.<\/p>\n<p>In response to this disturbance, we reviewed the recorded footage from the entire night and early morning. The recordings revealed that at 1:50 AM, the same individual was present at our living room window, making an obscene gesture directed towards it. Later, at 2:32 AM, the individual was again captured by the camera returning to the front of our residence and began to walk back and forth near our front door.<\/p>\n<p>The initial commotion that roused us at approximately 5:20 AM included more banging and stomping, audible even through silicone earplugs. The footage shows the individual exiting his residence with a dog, surveying the area as though to ensure no one was present. He then returned the dog indoors and re-emerged alone, continuing to pace near our front door while frequently glancing towards it, as if anticipating someone\u2019s appearance. This behavior persisted for roughly ten minutes, during which he expectorated on the door and proceeded to rearrange our outdoor chairs before ultimately damaging and removing the bird feeder, as previously described.<\/p>\n<p>It is noteworthy that the bird feeder had been installed for approximately one year, serving as a replacement for a prior feeder that had been similarly vandalized.<\/p>\n<p>At 5:50 AM, the individual was once again observed making an obscene gesture towards the camera and appeared to verbalize an insult, which could be interpreted as \u201cf**k off you stupid bastards,\u201d before retreating to his flat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Video:<\/strong> (<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">New camera setup, a21 phone camera in door peep hole + clear door view)<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #333333;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/span>(other camera: basic Microsoft webcam in living room window<\/span>)<br \/>\n<video controls=\"controls\" width=\"600\" height=\"340\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><source src=\"\/videos\/26th%20April%202024.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\" \/><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><\/video><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summery: On the 26th of April, 2024, our sleep was disrupted by significant noise.
