Surveillance footage revealed the individual residing at number 14 engaging in suspicious activity involving our letterbox. This individual was documented using a mobile device to peer inside our letterbox on two separate occasions: initially at 4:14 AM, and subsequently at 6:10 AM. During the latter instance, the device\u2019s flash was activated, and the camera application was visibly in use, suggesting the capture of photographic or video content. This evidence was promptly compiled and submitted to the police for investigation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reported To:<\/strong><br \/>\nWDH and the police<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impact:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Made us worried he will try doing something again, possible checking what camera we have and where they are as he seemed to be recording and\/or taking pictures with his phone, and he&#8217;ll be aware that the cameras can be viewed behind the front door from the time he previously put a brick through it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Points:<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tired, Very Stressed, Lucy has stress chest pain, and can&#8217;t sleep<\/p>\n<p><strong>Details:<br \/>\n<\/strong>In the early morning hours, we were awakened by a disturbance which was subsequently identified as the sound of our letterbox being tampered with. Upon reviewing the footage from our security cameras, it was evident that the individual responsible was the occupant of the flat at number 14. This person was observed utilizing a mobile device to peer into our letterbox.<\/p>\n<p>The presumed intent behind this action is to ascertain the locations of our security cameras. This deduction is based on the fact that immediately behind the entrance door, there is a laptop display that provides a live feed of two such cameras. The individual\u2019s awareness of this setup is likely due to a previous incident where they hurled a brick through our window, which afforded them a view of the interior.<\/p>\n<p>The initial occurrence of this behavior was recorded at precisely 4:14 AM, during which the individual was seen loitering and subsequently inspecting the letterbox with their phone, presumably capturing images or video. A subsequent incident was observed at 6:10 AM, which we witnessed in real-time, having been unable to return to sleep in anticipation of further disturbances.<\/p>\n<p>This matter was reported to the police; however, the response has been protracted over several months, with a lack of communication and follow-up on their part. Despite our efforts to obtain updates, we have not received any correspondence for over two and a half months from the time of this writing. The incident remains classified as \u2018open\u2019 on the official police website. Due to this apparent inaction, WDH has been impeded in their ability to proceed with their responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Video:<\/strong> (New camera setup, a21 phone camera in door peep hole + clear door view)<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>\u00a0~this setup was new and didn&#8217;t have a microphone at the time.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<video controls=\"controls\" width=\"600\" height=\"340\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><source src=\"\/videos\/09march2024-letterbox.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\" \/><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_end\">\ufeff<\/span><\/video><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summery: On the 9th of March 2024, we experienced an intrusion of privacy when we were disturbed by the sound&#46;&#46;&#46;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":201,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[4,13,5,7,6],"tags":[10],"class_list":["post-191","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-harassment","category-main-incidents","category-police","category-video","category-wdh","tag--video"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/191"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=191"}],"version-history":[{"count":14,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/191\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":628,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/191\/revisions\/628"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/201"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=191"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=191"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/192.168.0.108\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=191"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
